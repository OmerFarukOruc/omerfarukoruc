### The Short Version

I'm an embedded engineer who doesn't stop at the firmware boundary.

I've written C that controls cooling systems with 1–3°C precision, deployed devices across three continents, and walked into codebases with zero automated tests — then took part in building the entire testing infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline from scratch. I've also shipped a TypeScript dashboard for AI API management that somehow got 30 stars.

Currently working on safety-critical embedded firmware for agricultural machinery and building AI infrastructure tooling on the side.

### What I'm Working On

- 🔧 **Safety-critical embedded firmware** — real-time control systems for agricultural machinery
- 🧪 **Testing infrastructure** — took part in building CI/CD pipeline from zero: GoogleTest, Jenkins, SonarQube, automated quality gates
- 🤖 **AI tooling** — building developer tools for AI agent orchestration and API management
- 🏢 **NineTech** — running my consultancy alongside engineering work

---

### How I Think About Engineering

I believe the best embedded engineers are also infrastructure engineers. Writing firmware is half the job — the other half is making sure it doesn't break silently in production.

That's why I've invested heavily in:
- **Host-based testing** for hardware you can't run on a CI server
- **Declarative infrastructure** (NixOS) that makes deployment reproducible
- **Private networking** (Tailscale) that keeps development environments secure without the overhead

If I can't test it automatically, I don't trust it.
